### So this is a...

yep. Another magic mirror program, to display current date, weather of few cityes in the area, trains that my family often uses and time will tell what else. 

### The reason

In the mornings we usually get up, drink a coffe and wake the kids and prepare them for school. Each morning (except for summer) we usually ask our selfs these questions:

- What is the weather going to be today here and there?

- What time is it?

I want to display the needed information in a mirror!
